# Minimalistic-8-Bit-CPU
Slu4's home-built Minimalistic 8-Bit Computer
---------------------------------------------
Hi there! You have made it to my repo where I keep track of the files relevant to my 'Minimalistic 8-Bit Computer' design.
This includes (or will include in the future):

- KiCad schematics
- Control logic microcode (EEPROM data)
- Arduino sketches (VGA card and clock / RAM upload)
- Assember written in C++
- Emulator written in C++/OpenGL
- Operating system 'MinOS' (memory monitor aka WOZMON, absolute loader, bootstrap loader, save routine, memory filler, help screen, etc.)
- Software projects (32-bit math, displaying numbers in HEX / DEC, PONG and TETRIS clones I did for fun, etc.)

See my video series about the design on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYQcMpUBT3aaQKfmAVJNow

Cheers,
Slu4
